# Final Milestone
My final milestone is increased reliability of the funnel as well as the dispensing wheel. I added a second funnel which more accurately dispenses only one gumball into the area at a time, preventing the wheel from clogging and locking up from the excess of gumballs. In addition, I extended the ramp which the gumball rolls down with some extra acrylic parts. The main issue was the funnel entry way needed to be smaller than 4 inches to fit, but also 4 inches to fit the top, but I solved that by creating the outer layer into the place where the top sits.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was completely finishing the shell of the gumball machine and hooking up the electronics to it. The main issue was the acrylic available was not the correct size, so screws couldn't be used to attach all of the parts together. I solved this issue using super glue as a replacement for the screws. I created it by first glueing the shell together except the knock plate and the top. I then built the dispensing wheel, and attached all the electronics. Finally, I attached the necessary electronics to the knock plate, put the plate and top on, and filled it with some gumballs, and I had a complete Secret Knock Gumball Machine.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was connecting all the electronics and coding the arduino so that all of the electronic components were working. Initially, the circuit was wired to go on a PCB, but I edited the schematic to make it work on a breadboard. I coded the arduino to make it so when it heard a knock, it would register, determine whether the knock was correct or not. It would then flash the red or green light depending on whether it was wrong or right, and then only move the servo if the green light lit up.

# Starter Project
My starter project is the useless machine. As stated in the name, it is "useless". When the switch is flicked, an arm comes out of the box, hits a pressure switch, hits the mechanical switch into its original position, and then goes back into the box, making the machine do nothing. Initially, the arm was barely missing the switch and was making it so the machine was not doing its job. After lots of troubleshooting, I removed a couple of washers and replaced the arm part and it ended up working. However, other than that, it was smooth sailing.
